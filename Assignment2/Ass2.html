        <h1>Soccer vs Football</h1>
           <p>For years it's been North America vs the world when it comes to the nomenclature of the most played sport in the world. Surely a sport where 11 players pass around a ball with  their feet in an attempt to score should be called football, right?</p>

        <h2>Brief history of the word "Soccer" </h2>

       <p>It's been known for quite some time that the term "soccer" was a short-form derivative of association football. There have been plenty of people outside of the United States that have refused to admit it, but a primary source confirming it is substantial for the debate.</p>
        <p>This won't change much, though. Europeans will continue arguing it should only be called football. U.S. residents will call it soccer so as to not confuse anything with <span class="size"> American football</span>.</p>
