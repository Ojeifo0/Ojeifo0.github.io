        <h1>Should homework be made illegal?<img src="file:///Users/Centric/Downloads/illegal.jpeg"

        <p>There are many arguments advocating for the abolishment of homework, not  just from kids like myself and I, but also grown ups like <em>Dr. Kathleen M. Pape</em> who is a professional psychotherapist</p>
        <h2>Reasons for homework to be made abolished:</h2>
        <p><strong>Burnout:</strong> Prolonged exposure to heavy homework loads can lead to student burnout. Ex: the web design work we get every week</p>
        <p><strong>Inequity:</strong>Not all students have equal access to resources at home. Students with limited access to books, the internet, or a quiet place to study may be disadvantaged by homework  </p>
        <p><strong>Lack of sleep:</strong>Students who have a heavy homework load may be forced to stay up late to complete assignments and as a result <strong>miss morning labs ;)</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Lack of family time:</strong>Homework can encroach on family time, reducing opportunities for children to spend quality time with their families. </p>
        <p><strong>Reduced Interest in Learning:</strong>If homework becomes too much about rote memorization and test preparation, it can reduce a student's interest in learning for its own sake.</p>
        <p><strong>Time for Extracurricular Activities:</strong>Heavy homework loads can limit students' participation in extracurricular activities, which are important for personal development and college applications.</p>
        <p><strong>Quality Over Quantity:</strong>Some argue that the focus should be on the quality of homework rather than the quantity. Assigning meaningful, engaging tasks that reinforce classroom learning may be more beneficial than just giving students more work to do at home.</p>
